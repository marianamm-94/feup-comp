# Summary

This programming project aims to develop a compiler for a subset of the Java programming language, called “jmm”.
To make a compiler there are a few phases of compilation. First, the input file is parsed and an AST is generated. After the AST is parsed, a symbol table is generated. Finally, the OLLIR code is generated and the JASMIN code is generated from the Ollir input.
